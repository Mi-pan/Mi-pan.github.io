<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wikipedia shows a perfect map. (On the map
photo data on Wikipedia) As you can see, the expressway is similar to a
spiderweb, which has a rule. All the expressways in this Kanto area (Tokyo and
its surrounding 6 prefectures) consist of the routes that spreads from Tokyo
toward suburbs, and the route that are circular and look like some concentric
circles. Red roads are all <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span>, and green roads
are all different kind of expressways, which means transferring to those green
roads while driving on <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span> will cost you another
highway toll besides the toll for <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the circular routes, from the center,
inner 2 are C1(</span>都心環状線<span lang=EN-US>) and C2(</span>中央環状線<span
lang=EN-US>) (both of these are <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span>), and <span
class=SpellE>Gaikan</span>(</span>外環<span lang=EN-US>), Keno-do(</span>圏央道<span
lang=EN-US>) respectively (the last one is not on this map).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The speed limit on <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span>
is 50km/h on C1 (Inner Circular Route), 60km/h on most areas,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>and 80km/h on B; <span class=SpellE>Wangan-sen</span>
(Bayshore Route). However many cars tend to go over the speed limits. Nobody
calls police for your being<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>over-speed,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>so what you have
to care about is Police car (black and white one, and unmarked one which looks
like a normal sedan), Police motorcycle,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>speed cameras, mobile speed cameras.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It is important for you to look at the back
using the mirror of your car, as often as possible (don't be careless about the
front of course! Keep your eyes on the front!) for your changing lanes and to
detect the police car as early as possible. For your changing lanes, <span
class=SpellE>Shutoko's</span> drivers are skillful, changing lanes with the
distance between other cars so small and they tend to keep less distance when
traveling compared to drivers in other rural areas in Japan, so you have better
notice whether there are other cars around you, and its distance from you. It
is said that speed cameras will work and be effective when you go over speed
limit for 30km/h on normal public roads, and 40km/h on expressways, which means
you won't be caught by a police even if you travel at 115km/h under the speed
camera on Bayshore Route. However, an increasing number of mobile speed cameras
have started to be used, and its location changes day to day. (This mobile
speed camera is different from what we see outside the highways. On public
roads in residential areas, this camera operates with a policemen next to this
machine, so the proof of being over-speed is easy to be recorded and declared.
It is said that this mobile speed camera on normal roads at a residential area
will work and be effective when you go over a speed limit for 15 or 16km/h. Here,
the police in charge of it will stop your car right after your breaking the
speed limit, but on highways even police cannot stop your car because it's
dangerous of course, so I guess the amount of over-speed that make you caught
by police is different. A person must be over-speed by 30km or so if that
person is not caught red-handed, caught in the act, I think(?) )<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speed camera (permanent one, not mobile one
whose location moves day to day) on the side of the road can be searched on the
internet. Look at this website: https://orbis-guide.com/ Speed cameras are
called </span>オービス<span lang=EN-US>; Orbis in Japanese. There are several types
of it. Few decades ago, sometimes you were not caught by the police even if you
pass the camera at 200km/h because of running out of a film inside the machine,
but now every photos are taken digitally, and sent to police right away so you
will be caught 100% (still there are some cases of being not caught because of
the low quality, poor accuracy of the photo (to arrest someone, the driver's face
must be clear on the photo) ). The websites and recently many Apps make it easy
to detect speed cameras not only on <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span> but
everywhere in Japan. (On the roads, there is a machine called
&quot;N-system&quot; that looks similar to the speed camera. N-system just aim
to record our <span class=SpellE>licence</span> plate number, not the
travelling speed so you don't have to care about it, but some people who don't
know this slow down when passing through the machine...)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Police cars won't catch you for your being
over-speed by 10km/h or so because most cars are over speed limits and that's
the custom for us...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At every roads in Japan, if there are two
or more lanes, we must not travel using right lanes if there are no cars to
overtake or pass. However, in normal roads (roads that are everywhere and
require no tolls), many cars that do not pass other cars or that do not even
turn left, continue to drive at the left lane and this is one reason of the
inefficiency of Japanese roads (many cars that want to drive fast will be stuck
behind it).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span>
has it’s exits on both side and car merges from both side, so even if you keep
staying<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>on the right lane, the
police will almost not catch you for keep traveling on the wrong lane (you will
be caught on any other expressways, so be careful) (but there is a case of a
person being caught for this at <span class=SpellE>Shutoko</span> Bayshore
route (<span class=SpellE>Wangan</span> <span class=SpellE>sen</span>) because
there are exits on only left side just as a highway at a rural area, so try to
stay at left side of the road if there’re no cars to pass or if there're no
exits that you want to take at the right side)</span></p>
